A photo polling app for Instagram using InstagramOAuth2 and Instagram API

Permission scope: basic, public_content, follower_list, relationships

Original intent was to make an iOS app but to meet Instagram API policy change, quickly developed a rough MVP version of the web app (not following best practice) to be submitted for Instagram API permission review.
