A photo polling app for Instagram using InstagramOAuth2 and Instagram API

Permission scope: basic, public_content, follower_list, relationships

Original intent was to make an iOS app to meet Instagram API's policy change. A rough MVP version of the web app was quickly developed, so not following best practice in order submit and meet the deadline for Instagram API permission review.
